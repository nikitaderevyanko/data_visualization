## Squarified Treemaps
It is basic algorithm for visualization of Hierarchical structures in a way that would be easy to interpret.

In this particular example we use dataset with categories and sub-categories, each sub-category belongs to only one category. We create algorithm that creates squarified treemap for this hierarchy.

The paper about squarified treemaps is available via this link https://www.win.tue.nl/~vanwijk/stm.pdf
